        To manage your council tax online we need to connect to your council tax account.
      </p>

      <p>
        This process should take several minutes.

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          A recent council tax bill for the property.
        </li>
        <li>
          The month and year you became liable for paying council tax for the property. This may be the same as the date you legally took ownership of the property.
        </li>
